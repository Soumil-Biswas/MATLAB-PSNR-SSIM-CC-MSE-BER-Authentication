# MATLAB PSNR,SSIM,CC,MSE,BER Authentication
 A program to compare two Image files using PSNR (Peak Signal to Noise Ratio), SSIM (Structural Similarity index), MSE (Mean Squared Error) and CC (2D Correlation Coefficient) values.

## Unzipping The folder and using the Program

To use the project, unzip the contents of the ZIP/RAR file and run values.m using MATLAB (This project was created using MATLAB Version R2021a). Once the GUI opens, upload the images to be compared using the buttons "Load Image 1" and "Load Image 2". Finally, click on the "Generate" Button to recieve the PSNR, SSIM, MSE and CC values as output.

# Misc. Information

- This repository has individual programs under the respective folders to run the specific comparision procedure on a rudimentary level.

- the main file Values.m has further instructions on how to edit it. Using the MATLAB App Designer is preferred for this role.

- The main values.m file uses the imgtype.m function and therefore should always be placed in the same folder as values.m.
